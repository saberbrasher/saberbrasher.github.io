            <h2> About this page: </h2>

<p style="font-size: 18px;">Starting and leading a research project can be daunting, especially if this is your first time to do so. We currently live in a time where there are many different data products, skills, and methods to approach research questions (and figuring out what to do and why is a skill itself!). This page is by no means comprehensive, but it could serve as a launching/ starting point for students (or researchers interested in dipping their toes in climate science) to find data/skill training relevant to their study questions. </p>

<p style="font-size: 18px;">Below you will find a collection of resources that have provided useful over the years, including places to find data, some online handbooks for learning R, and a vague outline of how I break a new/ large project into chunks to make it less overwhelming. I'm happy to update this page - let me know if there is something great you think I should be here! </p>

<h2>Finding Data</h2>

<p>There are many climate data sources, all in various formats and resolutions, and they are spread out all over the internet. This page could never contain them all, but should be a good resource to start your data digging process. I have predominantly organized things by the format most of the data from the source is available in (which determines what skills needed to work with it). In addition to those below, <a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/search/index" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">NCEI</a> and <a href="https://data.gov" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Data.gov</a> are huge collections of data that you can search by key words and file types. Some important concepts and specific data products are also described by the <a href="https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu/climate-tools" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">NCAR Climate Data Guide</a>.</p>

Please reach out if you have interests in atmospheric science (climatology/ meteorology) or more general environmental science and climate interactions (especially if you are a previous student of mine!). There are a couple opportunities on campus that could fund your research activities (like the AURCA program in the College of Arts and Sciences) or you could potentially get research course credits if you are looking to get more hours for graduation.  </dd>

<h2>Coding in R</h2>

<p>Many climate data products need something beyond spreadsheets to work with them. This often means either learning to code (R or Python, typically) or using ArcGIS. Personally, once I became comfortable coding, I never used ArcGIS anymore. Thankfully, it is easier now to learn to code than ever… there are numerous help guides online, tons of help forums, and AI can even help troubleshoot simple code (don’t always trust it, though…). Below is a basic “starter kit” for R, my preferred programming language.</p>

<dl>
 <dt> <a href="https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">R and R Studio</a> </dt>
 <dd>- The first step in working with R. This is a free and easy download. Studio is the "Environment" that you interact with R in (basically, where you will do your writing, running, and troubleshooting, etc.). There are other IDEs out there, but Studio is pretty good and very intuitive to learn and get used to.  </dd>
 <dt> <a href="https://environmentalcomputing.net/about-this-site/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Environmental Computing</a> </dt>
 <dd>- An online textbook utilizing R for environmental data analysis. The book starts very basic/ beginner friendly and uses examples that are relevant/ could transfer to atmospheric sciences.   </dd>
 <dt> <a href="https://mgimond.github.io/Spatial/index.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">GIS and Spatial Analysis</a> </dt>
 <dd>- Explains/ teaches how many different GIS tasks can be done in R through a series of walkthroughs and example code. </dd>

<h2>Starting a Research Project</h2>

<p>Integrating ideas, thinking across disciplines, and condensing many seemingly separate studies to have some sort of holistic understanding of a field/ gaps in the literature is not easy. You must learn how to be systematically and strategically curious and to make connections across fields that there is a good chance you are very new to. Then, once you have a good idea… it turns out someone has done it already. Time to come up with something new!</p>

<p>Sounds easy, right?? Maybe not.. and it shouldn’t be! But like most things, breaking the process down into steps can make it much better.</p>

<dd>Some steps I think are important: </dd>
<dd>1. Conduct a literature search on the general topic that interests you (use key words that cover the topic, the geography, the field, etc., and try many different combinations of AND/EITHER/OR while adding/ removing different phrases if in Scopus/ Web of Science) </dd>
<dd>2. Read, read, read... but also make sure you are keeping track of what you have read (annotating/ making notes/ etc.)
Also read stuff that is more adjacent/ less specialized (I call this the funnel down approach, start "big picture" and get more specific as you go, eventually honing in on the niche of interest)</dd>
<dd>3. Develop an annotated bibliography of the literature - this should be detailed and organized by theme</dd>
<dd>4. THINK and ANALYZE - what knowledge gaps exist within this body of work? What hypothesis could aid in filling that gap (aka, what could YOU do?)</dd>
<dd>5. Write an essay to justify (justify being a KEY word - cite ample literature here that makes what you are proposing make sense) the hypothesis you propose to test (this becomes an excellent Introduction to a proposal!)</dd>
<dd>6. Write a lengthy description of what type of data you will collect (and WHY), including from where (metadata - strengths/ weaknesses), how much (temporal period/ spatial coverage, etc.), and how you will analyze it with an emphasis on WHY the methods were chosen (this will be a great draft of your Data and Methods section of your proposal/ eventual manuscript)</dd>
<dd>7. Get the data (or create it!) and do any necessary pre-processing (be sure to document everything you do in detail for reproducability)</dd>
<dd>8. Analyze data like you said you would; if you change any plans, be sure to document them and why</dd>
<dd>9. Digest the results of analysis (do they make sense??) and put in context of previous literature (would this make sense to others/ is it consistent with what you have read?)</dd>
<dd>10. Assuming everything seems good, check to make sure no more work on this topic has been published since you started (keep your literature base up to date)</dd>
<dd>11. Prepare a manuscript draft - clean it up so it is easy to read, but accept that it may still be ugly at this point</dd>
<dd>12. Send manuscript to at least one person you trust to give the first round of constructive feedback (advisor, other professors, colleagues, peers, etc.)</dd>
<dd>13. Revise, send it to other trusted individuals</dd>
<dd>14. Revise, revise, revise (never put "_final" at the end of a doc... you are lying)</dd>
<dd>15. Submit, eventually.</dd>

<dd>Creating new knowledge is a never ending cycle. Be prepared to have your views challenged and scrutinized - this is normal. Keep it up, and with time, the whole process will become second-nature.</dd>
