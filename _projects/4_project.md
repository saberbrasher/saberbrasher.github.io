<big> This is a new path of research that the lab is just beginning to explore. In recent years, more research has been conducted that truly integrates the fields of climatology and ecology, diving much deeper into the atmospheric dynamics driving species changes and biome shifts than ever before. Coupling advancing technology (weather radars and satellite remote sensing) that tracks Earth surface changes and movement of some species (birds and insects with radar and through citizen science apps like eBird) with methods in atmospheric science is a marriage that yields insight as to how changing climate regimes drive other environmental adaptations. </big>

        <p> As climate changes, the environment changes along with it. Habitats that used to be suitable for certain species no longer are, and areas that used to be too frigid become new potential territory. Rapid environmental change favors the generalist species, i.e. those that can adapt quickly, can rely on diverse resources, and typically that can easilly move when a habitat is no longer suitable. </p>
        
       <p> Species richness, or biodiversity, is a key component of a healthy and thriving ecosystem. What do these changes mean then for the non-generalists (specialists)?

        <p> Incorporating the state of the atmosphere, or the configuration of Rossby waves, the frequency of particular weather patterns, transitions in one climate regime to another... has shown to be increasingly useful, at a higher level of detail, in understanding ecological change. </p>
