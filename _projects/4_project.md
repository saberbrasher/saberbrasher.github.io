<big> This is a new path of research that the lab is just beginning to explore. In recent years, more research has been conducted that truly integrates the fields of climatology and ecology, diving much deeper into the atmospheric dynamics driving species changes and biome shifts than ever before. Coupling advancing technology (weather radars and satellite remote sensing) that tracks Earth surface changes and movement of some species (birds and insects with radar and through citizen science apps like eBird) with methods in atmospheric science is a marriage that yields insight as to how changing climate regimes drive other environmental adaptations. </big>

            You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these. This is a test to make the caption longer and see how it displays on the web page. How will it be formatted? Who knows... it is a mystery. The above image is of a snow covered landscape, with trees covered in snow, reaching over a chain link fence. It was taken after a winter storm in Delaware.
