<big> Every project has a beautiful feature showcase page.
It's easy to include images in a flexible 3-column grid format.
Make your photos 1/3, 2/3, or full width. </big>

    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

            You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these. This is a test to make the caption longer and see how it displays on the web page. How will it be formatted? Who knows... it is a mystery. The above image is of a snow covered landscape, with trees covered in snow, reaching over a chain link fence. It was taken after a winter storm in Delaware.
