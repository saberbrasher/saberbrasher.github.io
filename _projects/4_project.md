<p style="font-size: 20px;"> This is a new path of research for the lab. In recent years, more research has been conducted that integrates the fields of climatology and ecology, diving deeper into the atmospheric dynamics driving species changes and biome shifts than ever before. Coupling advancing technology (weather radars and satellite remote sensing) that tracks Earth surface changes and movement of species (birds and insects with radar and through citizen science apps like eBird, plant species with remote sensing) with methods in atmospheric science is a marriage that yields insight as to how changing climate regimes drive other environmental adaptations. </p>

        <p style="font-size: 18px;"> As climate changes, the environment changes along with it. Habitats that used to be suitable for certain species no longer are, and areas that used to be too frigid (or unsuitable) potentially become new livable territory. </p>
        
        <p style="font-size: 18px;">Rapid environmental change favors the generalist species, i.e. those that can adapt quickly, can rely on diverse resources, and that typically can easilly move when a habitat is no longer suitable. </p>
        
       <p style="font-size: 18px;">Incorporating the physical state of the atmosphere, things such as the configuration of Rossby waves, the frequency of particular weather patterns, transitions from one climate regime to another... has shown to be increasingly useful, at a higher level of detail, in understanding ecological change. </p> 
        
        <p style="font-size: 18px;">Species richness, or biodiversity, is a key component of a healthy and thriving ecosystem. What do rapid environmental changes mean then for the non-generalists (the specialists)? How can climate science be utilized to better understand biodiversity?

        <p style="font-size: 20px;"> Ideas are evolving, but some questions of interest include:</p> 
        <p style="font-size: 18px; font-style: italic;"> How can synoptic climatology be used as a tool in better understanding migratory behaviors? Or to better understand niche species domains? </p>  
        <p style="font-size: 18px; font-style: italic;"> How are climate change-induced (determined through synoptic climatological methods or by analyzing climate model output) land management practices (for things such as recreation, agriculture, or urbanization) impacting species richness? How can such strategies evolve to improve biodiversity? </p>  
        <p style="font-size: 18px; font-style: italic;"> How can hydroclimatic changes (atmospheric variables along with water access and input to streams and local waterways) be better utlized in determining geographic range shifts of generalist species? </p>  
        <p style="font-size: 20px;"> The lab is actively seeking interdisciplinary collaborations to tackle such questions. If you are a scholar or student with expertise or interest in these areas, we'd love to chat!</p>
