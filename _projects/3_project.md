<p style="font-size: 20px;"> The surface cover of the earth is a dynamic and integral part of the radiation balance; as such, changes from one surface cover type to another have implications for energy fluxes across the planet. The spectral differences between a cryo-covered (ice or snow) and a bare (exposed ground or open ocean) surface are extreme with the cryo-covered surface typically having a much higher albedo than the bare surface. This shift in albedo from one surface type to the other and resulting impacts on the radiation balance have been the subject of much research, although many additional implications are still unknown. 
</p>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;"> The Earth's cryo-cover (defined here as snow cover and sea ice) is dynamic and varies considerably on both interannual and seasonal time-scales. Consensus agrees that snow cover and sea ice areas are changing, but there is still much work to be done on where, how much, and what influence these changes will have. </p>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
        <p style="font-size: 18px;"> The lab has analyzed snow cover and sea ice both as a comprehensive cryo-cover spatially and temporally but also as distinct cover types. Distinction between the type of cryo-cover present (whether it is a stable/ consistent cover or a transient/ephemeral cover) has also been studied, as coverage consistency complicates radiative processes and dynamics. </p>
        
        <p style="font-size: 18px;"> Cryo-cover spatiotemporal variations, and transitions, are a crucial component of the global climate system. </p>

<p style="font-size: 18px;"> Determining specific regions that vary in a synergistic way, and perhaps are also influenced by similar mechanisms (be it specific teleconnections or otherwise) will be a key component in understanding the radiative impacts of a changing cryosphere in a warming climate.

       <p style="font-size: 18px;"> Not all agricultural producers have access (or the training) to implement/ interpret high-tech decision-support tools to make irrigation decisions. Atmometers, or ET gages, are a low-cost alternative for informed irrigation. 
</p>
        
        <p style="font-size: 18px;"> Reference evapotranspiration data from atmometers at three locations on the Delmarva Peninsula (USA) were compared to Penman-Monteith reference evapotranspiration (ETo) data across two growing seasons to assess their performance. Atmometer reference evapotranspiration (ETa) was found to underestimate ETo by 22.8% in 2016 and 30.4% in 2017. 
</p>
        
        <p style="font-size: 18px;"> Derived from local meteorological data, three dominant synoptic atmospheric categories were defined during the study period: High Pressure (HP), Southwest Flow (SW), and Cold Fronts (CF). Overall, the similarity between ETa and ETo was greatest on HP days, followed by CF and SW days.

        <p style="font-size: 18px;"> We determined that atmometer performance was most impacted by wind speed, which had the greatest influence on ETa-ETo differences under all synoptic weather patterns. 
</p> 

        <p style="font-size: 18px;"> The 2016 growing season consisted of more days with synoptic conditions that are associated with smaller ETa -ETo differences than the 2017 growing season. Thus, changes in synoptic category frequency impact the nature of the ETa-ETo relationship from season to season. 
</p>
        
        <p style="font-size: 18px;"> The result was correction factors with synoptic weather patterns and descriptions to improve the utility of atmometers and remove the need for expensive meteorological equipment to correct atmometer data for those without access.

        <p style="font-size: 18px;"> Evolving work centers on Oklahoma. Agriculture consumes more than 34,400,000 of its total 44,080,000 acres, ranking it 4th in the nation for agricultural activities. It is crucial for agricultural communities to understand climatology and water resources when determining irrigation practices.  
</p>

        <p style="font-size: 18px;"> Many Oklahoma crops depend on irrigation, especially corn and cotton, which have seen increases in the total number of irrigated acres since 2013. Both crops are planted in the spring, grown in the summer, and harvested in the fall, making them susceptible to increasing summer temperatures and drought.

    <div class="col-sm-7">
             <p style="font-size: 18px;"> To explore these relationships, three counties are being analyzed from 2010 - 2020: Jackson County (the highest producer of cotton), Texas County (the highest producer of corn), and Tillman County (a high producer of both cotton and corn).
 </p>
        
        <p style="font-size: 18px;"> The following questions guide this work:
What is the relationship between corn and cotton irrigation and climate (precipitation and temperature)?  How has drought impacted cotton and corn production in Oklahoma, specifically in Spring and Summer? </p>
        
        <p style="font-size: 18px;"> Some preliminary findings: Tillman County cotton production decreased by 75% from 2011-2013 coinciding with exceptionally dry Springs and a spike in irrigation. Spring and Summer of 2011-2012 had exceptionally high temperatures as well. Crop cover largely decreased the following years (2012 and 2013) as the demand for irrigation increased. Riddled by dry conditions coupled with extremely high temperatures, the study period of 2010 – 2020 covers a tumultuous period for Oklahoma agriculture. </p>

        <p style="font-size: 18px;"> The lab is currently addressing the following questions: </p>
        
<p style="font-size: 18px; font-style: italic;"> In Oklahoma, water is accessed via a mix of wells and surface water, and irrigation decisions are not always made by the same deciding factors.  How can irrigation decisions (driven by climate) be directly linked to water availability? </p>

<p style="font-size: 18px; font-style: italic;">How can irrigation decision-making be better informed by climatology in a way that is easily accessible? In what parts of the country would this type of decision-support tool be most useful and quickly integrated? How can climate models and irrigation predictors better include the diverse needs of non-homogenous environments and agriculturalists?  </p>

<p style="font-size: 18px; font-style: italic;">Streamflow and gage height measurements are widely used across the country to make important safety decisions - with the growing number of tools available to forecast streams, how can incorporating relevant physical landscape features and regional climatology improve performance? At what cost to processing/ run time and spatial coverage? </p>

<p style="font-size: 18px; font-style: italic;">High-impact flooding and drought events often follow specific synoptic atmospheric precursors. In those areas most at risk, how can synoptic climatology better forecast the occurrence and explain the variance in frequency of both extremes?
