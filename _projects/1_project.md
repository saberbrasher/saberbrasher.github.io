<big> Every project has a beautiful feature showcase page.
It's easy to include images in a flexible 3-column grid format.
Make your photos 1/3, 2/3, or full width. </big>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0 text-center">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/p1_1.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.
</div>

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-6">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/p1_3.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
        <div class="caption">
            You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these. This is a test to make the caption longer and see how it displays on the web page. How will it be formatted? Who knows... it is a mystery. The above image is of a snow covered landscape, with trees covered in snow, reaching over a chain link fence. It was taken after a winter storm in Delaware.
