<p style="font-size: 20px;"> The surface cover of the earth is a dynamic and integral part of the radiation balance; as such, changes from one surface cover type to another have implications for energy fluxes across the planet. The spectral differences between a cryo-covered (ice or snow) and a bare (exposed ground or open ocean) surface are extreme with the cryo-covered surface typically having a much higher albedo than the bare surface. This shift in albedo from one surface type to the other and resulting impacts on the radiation balance have been the subject of much research, although many additional implications are still unknown.

        <p style="font-size: 18px;"> The Earth's cryo-cover (defined here as snow cover and sea ice) is dynamic and varies considerably on both interannual and seasonal time-scales. Consensus agrees that snow cover and sea ice areas are changing, but there is still much work to be done on where, how much, and what influence these changes will have. </p>
        
        <p style="font-size: 18px;"> Snow cover and sea ice have been analyzed as a comprehensive cryo-cover spatially and temporally but also as distinct cover types. Distinction between the type of cryo-cover present (whether it is a stable/ consistent cover or a transient/ephemeral cover) has also been researched, as coverage consistency complicates radiative processes and dynamics. </p>
        
        <p style="font-size: 18px;"> Cryo-cover spatiotemporal variations, and transitions, are a crucial component of the global climate system. Many of the teleconnections between a rapidly changing cryosphere and larger atmospheric dynamics are still unknown.        </p>

        <p style="font-size: 20px;"> Ideas are evolving, but some questions of interest include:</p> 
        <p style="font-size: 18px; font-style: italic;"> How can synoptic climatology be used as a tool in better understanding migratory behaviors? Or to better understand niche species domains? </p>  
        <p style="font-size: 18px; font-style: italic;"> How are climate change-induced (determined through synoptic climatological methods or by analyzing climate model output) land management practices (for things such as recreation, agriculture, or urbanization) impacting species richness? How can such strategies evolve to improve biodiversity? </p>  
        <p style="font-size: 18px; font-style: italic;"> How can hydroclimatic changes (atmospheric variables along with water access and input to streams and local waterways) be better utlized in determining geographic range shifts of generalist species? </p>  
        <p style="font-size: 20px;"> The lab is actively seeking interdisciplinary collaborations to tackle such questions. If you are a scholar or student with expertise or interest in these areas, we'd love to chat!</p>
