<p style="font-size: 20px;"> The surface cover of the earth is a dynamic and integral part of the radiation balance; as such, changes from one surface cover type to another have implications for energy fluxes across the planet. The spectral differences between a cryo-covered (ice or snow) and a bare (exposed ground or open ocean) surface are extreme with the cryo-covered surface typically having a much higher albedo than the bare surface. This shift in albedo from one surface type to the other and resulting impacts on the radiation balance have been the subject of much research, although many additional implications are still unknown. 
</p>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;"> The Earth's cryo-cover (defined here as snow cover and sea ice) is dynamic and varies considerably on both interannual and seasonal time-scales. Consensus agrees that snow cover and sea ice areas are changing, but there is still much work to be done on where, how much, and what influence these changes will have. </p>

        <p style="font-size: 18px;"> Cryo-cover spatiotemporal variations, and transitions, are a crucial component of the global climate system. Many of the teleconnections between a rapidly changing cryosphere and larger atmospheric dynamics are still unknown.        </p>

            Box plots of cryo- cover annual cycle (1979–2020) in millions of km2, with light blue representing combined (both snow and ice) cover, dark blue ice and green snow. The distance between the “tails” of each boxplot denote the range of values (where the lower point is the minimum, and the upper point the maximum for the month). The lower edge of the box represents the first quartile, the upper edge of the box the third quartile, and the line near the center of each box is the median value for that year.
