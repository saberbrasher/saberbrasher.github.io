Abby is returning to the lab for a second year! Her research has been funded by the [AURCA Program](https://cas.okstate.edu/undergraduate_research/aurca_program/) at OSU. She will be continuing work on climate and water availability in Oklahoma that she started last year, you can learn more about her [here](https://saberbrasher.github.io/people/). Very happy to have you back, Abby!
