After picking away at this website all summer, I'm very excited to have it go live and be out in the world! 

***

Fall 2023 will be a busy time for the HydRA lab... we have returning students, new students, and a lot on the horizon. 

#### This semester I am teaching:
<ul>
    <li>Climatology</li>
    <li>Climate Change and Humanity</li>
</ul>
