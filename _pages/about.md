<big> Housed in the <a href='https://cas.okstate.edu/department_of_geography/'>Department of Geography</a> at Oklahoma State University and led by Dr. Saber E. Brasher, the HydRA lab studies <b>Hydroclimate and EnviRonmental Adaptation to climate change</b>. Climate change touches all aspects of the natural world, with shifting weather patterns and water regimes changing the environment at a rapid rate. The lab is grounded in the field of Climatology, but incorporates adjacent disciplines such as Meteorology, Environmental Science, Biogeography, and Hydrology to study environmental changes more holistically.
