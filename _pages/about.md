<span style="font-size: 20px;"> The HydRA lab studies <b> Hydroclimate and EnviRonmental Adaptation to climate change </b> at Oklahoma State University. Climate change touches all aspects of the natural world, with shifting weather patterns and water regimes changing the environment at a rapid rate. The lab is grounded in the field of Climatology, but frequently delves into adjacent disciplines such as Meteorology, Environmental Science, and Biogeography to study environemntal changes more holistically. </style>
