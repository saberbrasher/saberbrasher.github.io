The HydRA lab studies <b><u> Hydroclimate and EnviRonmental Adaptation to climate change </u></b> at Oklahoma State University. Climate change touches all aspects of the natural world, with shifting weather patterns and water regimes changing the environment at a rapid rate. The lab is grounded in the field of Climatology, but frequently incorporates adjacent disciplines such as Meteorology, Environmental Science, Biogeography, and Hydrology to study environemntal changes more holistically.

Follow the header links above to learn more about specific research themes, lab members, papers published by the group, and teaching and mentoring statements from the lab's PI, Dr. Saber E. Brasher.
