<h2> About this page: </h2>


<p style="font-size: 18px;">Starting and leading a research project can be daunting, especially if this is your first time to do so. We currently live in a time where there are many different data products, skills, and methods to approach research questions (and figuring out what to do and why is a skill itself!). This page is by no means comprehensive, but it could serve as a launching/ starting point for students (or researchers interested in dipping their toes in climate science) to find data/skill training relevant to their study questions. </p>

<p style="font-size: 18px;">Below you will find a collection of resources that have provided useful over the years, including places to find data, some online handbooks for learning R, and a vague outline of how I break a new/ large project into chunks to make it less overwhelming. </p>

<p style="font-size: 18px;">For the data section: There are many climate data sources, all in various formats and resolutions, and they are spread out all over the internet. This page could never contain them all, but should be a good resource to start your data digging process. I have predominantly organized things by the format most of the data from the source is available in (which determines what skills needed to work with it). I'm happy to update this page - let me know if there is something great you think I should add! </p>

 <dt> Undergraduate Students: </dt>
 <dd>- I enjoy working with undergraduates who are excited about learning the ins and outs of research.  Please reach out if you have interests in atmospheric science (climatology/ meteorology) or more general environmental science and climate interactions (especially if you are a previous student of mine!). There are a couple opportunities on campus that could fund your research activities (like the AURCA program in the College of Arts and Sciences) or you could potentially get research course credits if you are looking to get more hours for graduation.  </dd>

<h2>Learning to Code</h2>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-6">
<p style="font-size: 18px;">Research without education and outreach accomplishes very little. The terms “climate change” and “global warming”, along with the increasing severity of extreme weather events, has moved climate science to the forefront of public discourse. I believe that education is powerful; it builds confidence and creates advocates for our planet. </p>

<p style="font-size: 18px;">Environmental sciences are powerful tools in situational awareness: the subject matter is always around us. Regardless of the course level, my first teaching objective is to have students situate themselves within the discipline. I do this through mixed methods, such as including relevant news articles involving climate and the environment, photos and videos of areas undergoing environmental change, and by incorporating project work that engages students in research. </p>

 <dt> Meteorology (GEOG 3033): </dt>
 <dd>- Introduces weather processes, including how energy, moisture, and variation in land cover surfaces influence weather phenomena across space. The course begins with an introduction to the atmosphere and how energy exchanges and physics dictate atmospheric motion before diving into atmospheric processes and specific weather phenomena, including winds, hurricanes, tornadoes, cyclones, etc., and how all are linked to the atmosphere’s state of stability. Meteorological hazards and extreme events are also discussed. </dd>
 <dt> Climatology (GEOG 3023): </dt>
 <dd>- Provides an overview of the components of the Earth’s climate system, including the atmosphere, oceans, land and sea ice, and the biosphere. We explore how the climate system works, how it affects us, how we affect it, and how it has changed and is changing. Climate, and its influences, are complicated. This course will build a foundation in atmospheric science before diving into real world examples, complex interactions with the atmosphere and other Earth “Spheres”, and relevant research on climate issues. </dd>
 <dt> Climate Change and Humanity (GEOG/GEOL 1022): </dt>
 <dd>- Introduces Earth and environmental sciences, with an emphasis on the atmosphere and how it impacts life on Earth as well as how living things have changed it. Outlines the basics of climate change and what makes it complicated, how climate interacts with all components of the Earth-system, and where changes are most magnified. Future climate impacts and scenarios are also discussed. </dd>
