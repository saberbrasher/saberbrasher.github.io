<h2> About this page: </h2>


<p style="font-size: 18px;">Starting and leading a research project can be daunting, especially if this is your first time to do so. We currently live in a time where there are many different data products, skills, and methods to approach research questions (and figuring out what to do and why is a skill itself!). This page is by no means comprehensive, but it could serve as a launching/ starting point for students (or researchers interested in dipping their toes in climate science) to find data/skill training relevant to their study questions. </p>

<p style="font-size: 18px;">Below you will find a collection of resources that have provided useful over the years, including places to find data, some online handbooks for learning R, and a vague outline of how I break a new/ large project into chunks to make it less overwhelming. </p>

<h2>Data</h2>

There are many climate data sources, all in various formats and resolutions, and they are spread out all over the internet. This page could never contain them all, but should be a good resource to start your data digging process. I have predominantly organized things by the format most of the data from the source is available in (which determines what skills needed to work with it). I'm happy to update this page - let me know if there is something great you think I should add! In addition to those below,

Please reach out if you have interests in atmospheric science (climatology/ meteorology) or more general environmental science and climate interactions (especially if you are a previous student of mine!). There are a couple opportunities on campus that could fund your research activities (like the AURCA program in the College of Arts and Sciences) or you could potentially get research course credits if you are looking to get more hours for graduation.  </dd>

<h2>Learning to Code</h2>


<p style="font-size: 18px;">Environmental sciences are powerful tools in situational awareness: the subject matter is always around us. Regardless of the course level, my first teaching objective is to have students situate themselves within the discipline. I do this through mixed methods, such as including relevant news articles involving climate and the environment, photos and videos of areas undergoing environmental change, and by incorporating project work that engages students in research. </p>

<dl>
 <dt> Meteorology (GEOG 3033): </dt>
 <dd>- Introduces weather processes, including how energy, moisture, and variation in land cover surfaces influence weather phenomena across space. The course begins with an introduction to the atmosphere and how energy exchanges and physics dictate atmospheric motion before diving into atmospheric processes and specific weather phenomena, including winds, hurricanes, tornadoes, cyclones, etc., and how all are linked to the atmosphere’s state of stability. Meteorological hazards and extreme events are also discussed. </dd>
 <dt> Climatology (GEOG 3023): </dt>
 <dd>- Provides an overview of the components of the Earth’s climate system, including the atmosphere, oceans, land and sea ice, and the biosphere. We explore how the climate system works, how it affects us, how we affect it, and how it has changed and is changing. Climate, and its influences, are complicated. This course will build a foundation in atmospheric science before diving into real world examples, complex interactions with the atmosphere and other Earth “Spheres”, and relevant research on climate issues. </dd>
 <dt> Climate Change and Humanity (GEOG/GEOL 1022): </dt>
 <dd>- Introduces Earth and environmental sciences, with an emphasis on the atmosphere and how it impacts life on Earth as well as how living things have changed it. Outlines the basics of climate change and what makes it complicated, how climate interacts with all components of the Earth-system, and where changes are most magnified. Future climate impacts and scenarios are also discussed. </dd>

<h2>Starting a Research Project</h2>

Integrating ideas, thinking across disciplines, and condensing many seemingly separate studies to have some sort of holistic understanding of a field/ gaps in the literature is not easy. You must learn how to be systematically and strategically curious and to make connections across fields that there is a good chance you are very new to. Then, once you have a good idea... it turns out someone has done it already. Time to come up with something new!

Sounds easy, right?? Maybe not.. and it shouldn't be! But like most things, breaking the process down into steps can make it much better.

Some steps I think are important: 

<dd>1. Conduct a literature search on the general topic that interests you (use key words that cover the topic, the geography, the field, etc., and try many different combinations of AND/EITHER/OR while adding/ removing different phrases if in Scopus/ Web of Science) </dd>
<dd>2. Read, read, read... but also make sure you are keeping track of what you have read (annotating/ making notes/ etc.)
Also read stuff that is more adjacent/ less specialized (I call this the funnel down approach, start "big picture" and get more specific as you go, eventually honing in on the niche of interest)</dd>
<dd>3. Develop an annotated bibliography of the literature - this should be detailed and organized by theme</dd>
<dd>4. THINK and ANALYZE - what knowledge gaps exist within this body of work? What hypothesis could aid in filling that gap (aka, what could YOU do?)</dd>
<dd>5. Write an essay to justify (justify being a KEY word - cite ample literature here that makes what you are proposing make sense) the hypothesis you propose to test (this becomes an excellent Introduction to a proposal!)</dd>
<dd>6. Write a lengthy description of what type of data you will collect (and WHY), including from where (metadata - strengths/ weaknesses), how much (temporal period/ spatial coverage, etc.), and how you will analyze it with an emphasis on WHY the methods were chosen (this will be a great draft of your Data and Methods section of your proposal/ eventual manuscript)</dd>
<dd>7. Get the data (or create it!) and do any necessary pre-processing (be sure to document everything you do in detail for reproducability)</dd>
<dd>8. Analyze data like you said you would; if you change any plans, be sure to document them and why</dd>
<dd>9. Digest the results of analysis (do they make sense??) and put in context of previous literature (would this make sense to others/ is it consistent with what you have read?)</dd>
<dd>10. Assuming everything seems good, check to make sure no more work on this topic has been published since you started (keep your literature base up to date)</dd>
<dd>11. Prepare a manuscript draft - clean it up so it is easy to read, but accept that it may still be ugly at this point</dd>
<dd>12. Send manuscript to at least one person you trust to give the first round of constructive feedback (advisor, other professors, colleagues, peers, etc.)</dd>
<dd>13. Revise, send it to other trusted individuals</dd>
<dd>14. Revise, revise, revise (never put "_final" at the end of a doc... you are lying)</dd>
<dd>15. Submit, eventually.</dd>

<dd>Creating new knowledge is a never ending cycle. Be prepared to have your views challenged and scrutinized - this is normal. Keep it up, and with time, the whole process will become second-nature.</dd>
