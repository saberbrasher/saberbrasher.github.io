<h2> About this page: </h2>

<p style="font-size: 20px;"> Academia can be an odd place to navigate, especially as a first-generation or minority-identifying student/ scholar. There are a lot of "unwritten rules" for how to behave within the academy, how to communicate, and how to do your work. As a first-generation scholar myself, I am still learning the systems too, and I urge all students and prospective graduate researchers to remember the following: <b> there are no stupid questions. </b></p>



<p style="font-size: 18px;">A thirst to never stop learning and to continuously improve goes much farther than "book smarts", and drive (sometimes with a dash of stubbornness) will get you through the times that you wonder if finishing is worth it. Along the way though, don't struggle alone. Find your people. Whatever stage you are at in your career, find people that support you in the direction of your dreams. </p>

<p style="font-size: 18px;">As an educator, mentor, advisor, I strive to push students (of all stages) to new insights, to challenge them along the way, but to also create an environment that they know is safe for asking questions. Failure happens and is often the catalyst for the biggest breakthroughs. Overcoming hardship builds confidence, and my goal is to create a space where failure is just seen as part of the process and not an end to discovery. </p>

<p style="font-size: 18px;">I have been fortunate to have excellent mentors - some were my research advisors, and others were faculty in my departments who were kind enough to give me their time when they had no obligation to. </p>

<p style="font-size: 18px;">What drew me to this job, aside from an insatiable curiosity about the world around me, was mentorship. There is still a lot of inequity in the sciences and academia - most of the atmospheric sciences is still white and male. Some students are fortunate to have families support their pursuits in higher ed, where those who don't often struggle and find themselves lost. When I was lost in the academia maze, I had academic mentors that supported me and taught me, but not everyone is so lucky. </p>

<p style="font-size: 18px;">I approach mentorship by leaning into the non-traditional path that led me here but also by acknowledging my privilege to even have had higher education accessible to me, and now as a professor, to do work that inspires me from a place of stability. </p>

<p style="font-size: 18px;">I try to embody the characteristics that I respected the most about my own mentors: transparency, clear expectations, consistent feedback, openness to new ideas, and enthusiasm. I expect my students to work hard, but by no means do I expect perfection - what I do expect is a growth mindset and consistent efforts toward self-improvement. I hold myself to these same standards. </p>

<p style="font-size: 18px;">Students in the lab can expect to have regular 1 on 1 meetings with me (more frequently the earlier they are in their graduate career) but they are also highly encouraged to help one another and to find assistance (and comfort!) in their colleagues. </p>

<p style="font-size: 18px;"> I see students as future colleagues and adults, and as such I expect them to treat graduate school as they would any other fulltime job. I expect students to keep me informed as to when they will be unavailable or travelling, and they can expect a yearly performance review where we can both provide feedback to one another. I expect us to establish a working relationship that is grounded in clear and frequent communication. At the end of the day, I want all my students to succeed - to do that we need to make sure no issues fester or become bigger than they need to be. </p>

 <dt> Undergraduate Students: </dt>
 <dd>- I enjoy working with undergraduates who are excited about learning the ins and outs of research.  Please reach out if you have interests in atmospheric science (climatology/ meteorology) or more general environmental science and climate interactions (especially if you are a previous student of mine!). There are a couple opportunities on campus that could fund your research activities (like the AURCA program in the College of Arts and Sciences) or you could potentially get research course credits if you are looking to get more hours for graduation.  </dd>

<h2>Learning to Code</h2>

<p style="font-size: 18px;">Research without education and outreach accomplishes very little. The terms “climate change” and “global warming”, along with the increasing severity of extreme weather events, has moved climate science to the forefront of public discourse. I believe that education is powerful; it builds confidence and creates advocates for our planet. </p>

<p style="font-size: 18px;">Environmental sciences are powerful tools in situational awareness: the subject matter is always around us. Regardless of the course level, my first teaching objective is to have students situate themselves within the discipline. I do this through mixed methods, such as including relevant news articles involving climate and the environment, photos and videos of areas undergoing environmental change, and by incorporating project work that engages students in research. </p>

<dl>
 <dt> Meteorology (GEOG 3033): </dt>
 <dd>- Introduces weather processes, including how energy, moisture, and variation in land cover surfaces influence weather phenomena across space. The course begins with an introduction to the atmosphere and how energy exchanges and physics dictate atmospheric motion before diving into atmospheric processes and specific weather phenomena, including winds, hurricanes, tornadoes, cyclones, etc., and how all are linked to the atmosphere’s state of stability. Meteorological hazards and extreme events are also discussed. </dd>
 <dt> Climatology (GEOG 3023): </dt>
 <dd>- Provides an overview of the components of the Earth’s climate system, including the atmosphere, oceans, land and sea ice, and the biosphere. We explore how the climate system works, how it affects us, how we affect it, and how it has changed and is changing. Climate, and its influences, are complicated. This course will build a foundation in atmospheric science before diving into real world examples, complex interactions with the atmosphere and other Earth “Spheres”, and relevant research on climate issues. </dd>
 <dt> Climate Change and Humanity (GEOG/GEOL 1022): </dt>
 <dd>- Introduces Earth and environmental sciences, with an emphasis on the atmosphere and how it impacts life on Earth as well as how living things have changed it. Outlines the basics of climate change and what makes it complicated, how climate interacts with all components of the Earth-system, and where changes are most magnified. Future climate impacts and scenarios are also discussed. </dd>
