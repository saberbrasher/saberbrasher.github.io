<h2> To prospective students: </h2>

<p>Academia can be an odd place to navigate, especially as a first-generation or minority-identifying student/ scholar. There are a lot of "unwritten rules" for how to behave within the academy, how to communicate, and how to do your work. As a first-generation scholar myself, I am still learning the systems too, and I urge all students and prospective graduate researchers to remember the following: <b> there are no stupid questions. </b></p>

<p>A secret students should know? <b> No one has all of the answers. </b> The professors you idolize or are afraid of? They are still learning too, they have just gotten very good at asking questions (and finding the answers, which takes years of practice). </p>

<p>A thirst to never stop learning and to continuously evolve and improve goes much farther than "book smarts", and drive (sometimes with a dash of stubbornness) will get you through the times that you wonder if finishing is worth it. Along the way though, don't struggle alone. Find your people. Whatever stage you are at in your career, find people that support you in the direction of your dreams. </p>

<p>As an educator, mentor, advisor, I strive to push students (of all stages) to new insights, challenging them along the way, but also creating an environment that they know is safe for asking questions. Failure happens and is often the catalyst for the biggest breakthroughs. Overcoming hardship builds confidence, and my goal is to create a space where failure is just seen as part of the process and not an end to discovery. </p>

<p> <b> People believing in me as a scrappy, first-gen student who didn't know if she was smart or not (and was working 30+ hours a week at a restaurant to pay for college) are the reason I am in this position today. To give back some of what they gave to me is a gift. </b> As an educator and advisor, meeting my students where they are at is of the utmost importance to me. The path to diversifying academia requires good mentors and teachers, and it is my goal to contribute to this evolution: the environmental and societal problems of today and the future need all of us. </p>

<p>Research without education and outreach accomplishes very little. The terms “climate change” and “global warming”, along with the increasing severity of extreme weather events, has moved climate science to the forefront of public discourse. I believe that education is powerful; it builds confidence and creates advocates for our planet. For these reasons, I take my role as an educator and science communicator very seriously. </p>

<p>Most environmental sciences are powerful tools in situational awareness: the subject matter is always around us. Regardless of the course level, my first teaching objective is to have students situate themselves within the discipline. I do this through mixed methods, such as including relevant news articles involving climate and the environment, photos and videos of areas undergoing environmental change, and by incorporating project work that engages students in research. </p>

<p>Throughout my teaching, I keep in mind the following: How can I empower students to confidently discuss, and understand, such pertinent subject matters? Climate and environmental sciences directly influence all life on the planet. How, through my teaching, can I do the most good, for the students, but also for the planet? </p>

<h4> Courses taught at OSU: </h4>

<dl>
 <dt> Meteorology (GEOG 3033): </dt>
 <dd>- Introduces weather processes, including how energy, moisture, and variation in land cover surfaces influence weather phenomena across space. The course begins with an introduction to the atmosphere and how energy exchanges and physics dictate atmospheric motion before diving into atmospheric processes and specific weather phenomena, including winds, hurricanes, tornadoes, cyclones, etc., and how all are linked to the atmosphere’s state of stability. Meteorological hazards and extreme events are also discussed. </dd>
 <dt> Climatology (GEOG 3023): </dt>
 <dd>- Provides an overview of the components of the Earth’s climate system, including the atmosphere, oceans, land and sea ice, and the biosphere. We explore how the climate system works, how it affects us, how we affect it, and how it has changed and is changing. Climate, and its influences, are complicated. This course will build a foundation in atmospheric science before diving into real world examples, complex interactions with the atmosphere and other Earth “Spheres”, and relevant research on climate issues. </dd>
 <dt> Climate Change and Humanity (GEOG/GEOL 1022): </dt>
 <dd>- Introduces Earth and environmental sciences, with an emphasis on the atmosphere and how it impacts life on Earth as well as how living things have changed it. Outlines the basics of climate change and what makes it complicated, how climate interacts with all components of the Earth-system, and where changes are most magnified. Future climate impacts and scenarios are also discussed. </dd>
