<h2> To prospective students: </h2>
<p>Academia can be an odd place to navigate, especially as a first-generation or minority-identifying student/ scholar. There are a lot of "unwritten rules" for how to behave within the academy, how to communicate, and how to do your work. As a first-generation scholar myself, I am still learning the systems too, and I urge all students and prospective graduate researchers to remember the following: <b> there are no stupid questions. </b></p>

<p>A secret students should know? <b> No one has all of the answers. </b> The professors you idolize or are afraid of? They are still learning too, they have just gotten very good at asking questions (and finding the answers, which takes years of practice). </p>

<p>A thirst to never stop learning and to contuiously evolve and improve goes much farther than "book smarts", and drive (sometimes with a dash of stubbornness) will get you through the times that you wonder if finishing is worth it. Along the way though, don't struggle alone. Find your people. Whatever stage you are at in your career, find people that support you in the direction of your dreams. </p>

<p>As an educator, mentor, advisor, I strive to push students (of all stages) to new insights, challenging them along the way, but also creating an environment that they know is safe for asking questions. Failure happens and is often the catalyst for the biggest breakthroughs. Overcoming hardship builds confidence, and my goal is to create a space where failure is just seen as part of the process and not an end to discovery. </p>

<p> <b> People believeing in me as a scrappy, first-gen student who didn't know if she was smart or not (and was working 30+ hours a week at a restaurant to pay for college) are the reason I am in this position today. To give back some of what they gave to me is a gift. </b> As an educator and advisor, meeting my students where they are at is of the utmost importance to me. The path to diversifying academia requires good mentors and teachers, and it is my goal to contribute to this evolution: the environmental and societal problems of today and the future need all of us. </p>
