<p style="font-size: 20px;"> During my time as an Assistant Professor in the <a href='https://cas.okstate.edu/department_of_geography/'>Department of Geography</a> at Oklahoma State University I supervised, and still work with, some amazing students on various climatic topics. The HydRA lab studies <b>Hydroclimate and EnviRonmental Adaptation to climate change</b>. Climate change touches all aspects of the natural world, with shifting weather patterns and water regimes changing the environment at a rapid rate. The lab is grounded in the field of Climatology, but incorporates adjacent disciplines such as Meteorology, Biogeography, and Hydrology to study environmental changes more holistically. Read more about the lab members below. </p>

                        Saber joined the Department of Geography at Oklahoma State University in 2022 after receiving her PhD in Climatology from the University of Delaware. She is also an affiliate faculty member for the Environmental Science Graduate Program at OSU. Outside of her research and teaching, she is an avid outdoorswoman and spends most of her free time running, hiking, bird watching, or camping in the great outdoors. She often takes a camera on these ventures (most of the photos on the website are her own!). <br>

                        River would classify himself as chaotic good - he likes to keep things interesting, but is always happy to boost team morale! He loves to spend time on/around campus and to go for runs with his mom (Dr. B) so long as the weather isn't too hot or humid. He enjoys ALL foods, licking faces, and a good jaunt in the woods. Like a lot of Australian Shepherds, he is a ball of love (and hair)!

                        Inspired by a childhood love of DnD and odd creatures, the Hydra's three heads represent the diverse interests of the lab and the many moods of doing research. The mythical water dragon also serves as a reminder to not take yourself too seriously and that research should be fun (and is also sometimes weird)!
